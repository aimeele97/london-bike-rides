# London Bike Data Analysis

This Python script processes and analyzes bike rental data from London. It uses pandas for data manipulation and visualization libraries (Matplotlib and Seaborn) to explore the dataset.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Loads bike rental data from a CSV file.
- **Data Cleaning**: Renames columns for clarity, converts humidity values to percentages, and maps season and weather codes to descriptive strings.
- **Data Overview**: Displays the first few rows and structure of the dataset.
- **Data Export**: Saves the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file.

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundational framework for analyzing bike rental trends based on weather, seasonality, and other factors.
